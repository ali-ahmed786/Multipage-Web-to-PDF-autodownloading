# Multipage-Web-to-PDF-autodownloading
This python project uses Python library pyautogui's image recognition and system control features to download website as pdf files.
In this specific case this has been used to download manga webpages as pdf files. 
!!!NOTE!!!
This program is pixel specific and will only work on the website: https://demonslayer-mangaonline.com/manga/
To make it work on different devices and/or websites, the pictures being used for recognition and the coordinates will need to be adjusted.
